fzf
===

Configures [fzf] to use [bfs], [fd] or [ripgrep] for faster fetching of files and
directories names.

Sets ALT-C previews with ls. Also sets CTRL-T previews with [bat] if it's
installed. Press CTRL-/ to toggle the preview.

Requirements
------------

[fzf] must be installed already. And either [bfs], [fd] or [ripgrep] must be installed
already too.
